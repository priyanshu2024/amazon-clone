Amazon Clone – HTML & CSS Project Description

The Amazon Clone is a front-end web project designed to replicate the visual layout and user interface of the Amazon e-commerce platform using pure HTML and CSS. This project focuses on building a clean, responsive, and structured UI while closely following real-world website design practices.

The clone includes a fully styled header with a logo section, search bar, navigation links, and cart icon, similar to the original Amazon interface. The homepage layout is structured using modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid, ensuring proper alignment and spacing across all sections.

Key sections of the project include:

A navigation bar with category links

A hero/banner section for promotional content

Product cards displaying images, titles, prices, and ratings

A footer section with multiple columns for links and information

Special attention has been given to responsive design, making the layout adaptable for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using media queries. The project follows clean code practices with well-organized HTML structure and reusable CSS classes for maintainability.

Technologies Used

HTML5 for page structure and semantic markup

CSS3 for styling, layout, and responsiveness

Project Purpose

The main objective of this Amazon Clone is to strengthen front-end development skills, understand real-world website layouts, and practice converting a complex UI into a static web design using only HTML and CSS—without JavaScript or backend integration.

This project serves as a strong foundation for beginners and can later be extended with JavaScript functionality and backend integration for a full-stack e-commerce application.
